<ol>
<li> With The help of Theory Page , try to build the Circuit. </li>
<li> First of all build the ALU.</li>
<li> Then make the Shift Register</li>
<li>If You are unable to make it , load or export the circuit component directly and use it </li>
<li> Use Time variant input pulses to analyze the output <li>

		<h2>Digital Logic Design</h2><br/>
		This experiment is designed to simulate any digital logical circuit.Following are the instruction for building the circuit.The whole Applet consist of mainly four pannels i.e Left Pannel , Mid Pannel , Right Pannel and Top Pannel.
		<ol>
		<li>
		<b>Left Pannel</b> 

		</li>
		<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Gate Buttons: </b> So this buttons are used to draw basic gates like and,or,exor,not,nor,nand and exnor .After clicking this you just have to click on mid pannel drawing area.
		</li>
	<li>
	<b>Probe:</b>Generaly terminal output is shown by default, if you want explicitly Input and output of various node , then you have to probe it.
</li>
<li>
	<b>None:</b>It is used to get default cursor option back, so that you can do basic operation like drag and drop .
</li>

<li><b>Delete Element:</b> This is used for explicitly deleting certain element. You just have to click on those element.
</li>
<li><b>Connect/Disconnect:</b>This used for establishing and removing connection between various element. Connection can be established only from output to input.You have to first click to the output node then to the input node(consist of red square box) . For disconnection , also same procedure but this time you can start by clicking either of  input or output node.</li>
<li><b>Naming:</b>This is used for giving name to either input or output node. Just click on the node, then one input box will pop out in which you can give the name.
</li>
<li><b>Output:</b>Generally this is used for explicitly defining yhe output node. Its purpose will be more clear in explanation of import button.</li>
<li><b>Time Pulse</b>You have to enter time pulse in definate pattern i.e <timepulse_name>:<uptime>,<downtime>,<uptime>,<downtime> and so on.For ex: 0,10,10,10,10 . After that press enter or click on the new timepulse. Then, it will be created and available as input in list box.</li>
<li><b>Binary One And Zero</b>These are used to give value to terminal input and output</b></li>
</ol>
<li><b>Top Pannel</b></li>
<ol>
<li><b>Clear:</b>It is used to clear every element on the circuit</li>
<li><b>Save:</b>It is used for saving the circuit as file which can be loaded and imported.</li>
<li><b>Load:</b>It load the save circuit as it is without any change. It would be fresh circuit with no previous value stored.</li>
<li><b>Import:</b>Now it is a very important feature. It is simmilar to load , but circuit will appear as black box with terminal input ,terminal output and those output which are set by the output button on left pannel. So, in this recursively you can make many circuit.The input and output nodes will come in order of top to bottom on the basis of there vertical position while saving.It is imported as geeneric element whose name is derived from saved file's name.</li>
<li><b>Simulate:</b>This is used to compute the whole circuit , if all the terminal inputs are present . It also compute the gate delays , which can be known by hovering the mouse over the gates. By default gate delay is kept to be -1. Simulation can fail or give ambiguous result if circuit do not stablizes with time. This generally happens in the case of improper construction of feedbacks. For ex : If You use direct feedback in flip flop it will give You wrong or no result , i.e why use master slave architecture to build flip flop. </li>
</ol>

<li><b>Mid Pannel:</b>It is the just drawing area used for building various circuits.You can move various element in mid pannel by simple drag and drop.</li>


<li><b>Right Pannel:</b>It is used for showing time varying terminal inputs ,outputs and also probed input and output.It will have element name and input or output index associated with it. Indexes are given top to bottom.</li>

</ol>
<li><b>Note:</b>There is sample circuit for each experiment is given at the home page. You can try them with the help of save or import button.</li>
