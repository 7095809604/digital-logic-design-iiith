	<p>
	This module explains how to build a adder circuit.In electronics, an adder or summer is a digital circuit that performs addition of numbers. In many computers and other kinds of processors, adders are used not only in the arithmetic logic unit(s), but also in other parts of the processor, where they are used to calculate addresses, table indices, and similar.

	<b><h2> Half Adder </h2></b>
	
	<img src="../images/Half_Adder.svg.png" alt="2-d vectors" width="200px" style="float:left; margin:10px;"/>
	<p>	
	A half adder adds two one-bit binary numbers A and B to generate a 1-bit SUM(S) and a 1-bit CARRY(C) as the output.(the value theoretically carried on to the next addition); the final sum is 2C + S. The simplest half-adder design, pictured on the right, incorporates an XOR gate for S and an AND gate for C. Half adders cannot be used compositely, given their incapacity for a carry-in bit. The outputs S and C can be expressed as logical functions of input variables A,B as follows :  <br />
		SUM = 1 either if (A = 0 and B = 1) or if (A = 1 and B = 0). <br />
		CARRY = 1 only if (A = 1 and B = 1) <br />

<h2> Full Adder </h2>
	<img src="../images/Full_Adder.svg.png" alt="2-d vectors" width="200px" style="float:left; margin:10px;"/>

	<p>
	A full adder adds binary numbers and accounts for values carried in as well as out. A one-bit full adder adds three one-bit numbers, often written as A, B, and Cin; A and B are the operands, and Cin is a bit carried in (in theory from a past addition). The circuit produces a two-bit output sum typically represented by the signals Cout and S, where Sum=2 X Cout + S . A full adder can be implemented in many different ways such as with a custom transistor-level circuit or composed of other gates. One example implementation is with S = A exor B exor Cin and Cout = (A.B)+(Cin.(A exor B))

<h2> Ripple Carry Adder </h2>
	<img src="../images/ripple_carry_adder.svg.png" alt="2-d vectors" width="200px" style="float:left; margin:10px;"/>


	Multiple full adders can be used to create a N-bit adder. Each full adder inputs a Cin, which is the Cout of the previous adder. This kind of adder is a ripple carry adder, since each carry bit "ripples" to the next full adder. Note that the first (and only the first) full adder may be replaced by a half adder.

		<h2>Digital Logic Design</h2><br/>
		This experiment is designed to simulate any digital logical circuit.Following are the instruction for building the circuit.The whole Applet consist of mainly four pannels i.e Left Pannel , Mid Pannel , Right Pannel and Top Pannel.
		<ol>
		<li>
		<b>Left Pannel</b> 

		</li>
		<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Gate Buttons: </b> So this buttons are used to draw basic gates like and,or,exor,not,nor,nand and exnor .After clicking this you just have to click on mid pannel drawing area.
		</li>
	<li>
	<b>Probe:</b>Generaly terminal output is shown by default, if you want explicitly Input and output of various node , then you have to probe it.
</li>
<li>
	<b>None:</b>It is used to get default cursor option back, so that you can do basic operation like drag and drop .
</li>

<li><b>Delete Element:</b> This is used for explicitly deleting certain element. You just have to click on those element.
</li>
<li><b>Connect/Disconnect:</b>This used for establishing and removing connection between various element. Connection can be established only from output to input.You have to first click to the output node then to the input node(consist of red square box) . For disconnection , also same procedure but this time you can start by clicking either of  input or output node.</li>
<li><b>Naming:</b>This is used for giving name to either input or output node. Just click on the node, then one input box will pop out in which you can give the name.
</li>
<li><b>Output:</b>Generally this is used for explicitly defining yhe output node. Its purpose will be more clear in explanation of import button.</li>
<li><b>Time Pulse</b>You have to enter time pulse in definate pattern i.e <timepulse_name>:<uptime>,<downtime>,<uptime>,<downtime> and so on.For ex: 0,10,10,10,10 . After that press enter or click on the new timepulse. Then, it will be created and available as input in list box.</li>
<li><b>Binary One And Zero</b>These are used to give value to terminal input and output</b></li>
</ol>
<li><b>Top Pannel</b></li>
<ol>
<li><b>Clear:</b>It is used to clear every element on the circuit</li>
<li><b>Save:</b>It is used for saving the circuit as file which can be loaded and imported.</li>
<li><b>Load:</b>It load the save circuit as it is without any change. It would be fresh circuit with no previous value stored.</li>
<li><b>Import:</b>Now it is a very important feature. It is simmilar to load , but circuit will appear as black box with terminal input ,terminal output and those output which are set by the output button on left pannel. So, in this recursively you can make many circuit.The input and output nodes will come in order of top to bottom on the basis of there vertical position while saving.It is imported as geeneric element whose name is derived from saved file's name.</li>
<li><b>Simulate:</b>This is used to compute the whole circuit , if all the terminal inputs are present . It also compute the gate delays , which can be known by hovering the mouse over the gates. By default gate delay is kept to be -1. Simulation can fail or give ambiguous result if circuit do not stablizes with time. This generally happens in the case of improper construction of feedbacks. For ex : If You use direct feedback in flip flop it will give You wrong or no result , i.e why use master slave architecture to build flip flop. </li>
</ol>

<li><b>Mid Pannel:</b>It is the just drawing area used for building various circuits.You can move various element in mid pannel by simple drag and drop.</li>


<li><b>Right Pannel:</b>It is used for showing time varying terminal inputs ,outputs and also probed input and output.It will have element name and input or output index associated with it. Indexes are given top to bottom.</li>

</ol>
<li><b>Note:</b>There is sample circuit for each experiment is given at the home page. You can try them with the help of save or import button.</li>

<div id="quizzes" header="Quizzes">
<strong>
	<p>
		1) Design the full adder circuit as given in the theory section. Save this full adder circuit so that it can later be imported as a black box, which takes 3 inputs (A,B and C) and produces 2 outputs (Sum and Carry) 
		<br/><br/>
		2) Import Full Adder circuits designed in 1st part and construct a 4 BIT binary adder using 4 full adders. Given two 4 bit binary numbers a3a2a1a0 and b3b2b1b0, the circuit should output s3s2s1s0 and c-out which is the final carry. For circuit diagram, refer to the theory section 
		<br/><br/>
		3) Design a 3 bit full subtractor using EX-OR, AND, OR and NOT gates. Given X, Y and Z, the circuit should output D (difference) and B (Borrow). D = X (ex-or) Y (ex-or) Z and B = X'.Y + Y.Z + X'.Z 
		<br/><br/>
		4) Can the Final OR gate in the Full Adder circuit (given in the theory section) be replaced by an EX-OR gate ? If yes why? If no Why not?
