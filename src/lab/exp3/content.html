          	<h2> BCD to 7-segment Decoder </h2>
A BCD to 7-segment Decoder generates 7 outputs from a BCD (4-bit) input for driving a 7-segment LED display device to display BCD digits. A 7-segment display consists of seven segments designated as a, b, c, d, e, f and g in a clockwise sequence.
An optional DP decimal point (an "eighth segment") is used for the display of non-integer numbers.
In a 7-segment LED display, either all the anodes or all the cathodes of the LEDs in the seven segments are tied together and brought out at a single pin, and the device is accordingly called either a common-anode or a common-cathode display.
In this experiment, we will use a common-anode display, and so the Decoder outputs are applied through resistors placed in series with the cathode of each segment.
The objective of this experiment is to design, assemble and test a BCD to 7-segment Decoder generating these seven outputs. Note that each segment is lighted when the corresponding decoder output, also denoted by a, b, c, d, e, f and g, is LOW.

 <p>
 The natural choice for a design involving 4 input variables is a 4-input multiplexer, and the best choice for the Select inputs for BCD input is BA, as that would give us the maximum benefit of don’t care combinations.
 </p>
  <img src="../images/7-segment-decoder.png" />
  <p>
  There are only five distinct values that these 28 data inputs have, and these are 0, 1, C, C’ and D’•C’ = (D + C)’. Thus a 2-input NOR gate and an inverter are all that is needed to generate all the required data inputs. Moreover, one realises that as 4-input multiplexers come two in a chip, one multiplexer IC would only be half utilised if all the 7 outputs are generated with multiplexers, and hence one could save on the chip count if one of the segment inputs could be realised using 2-input NOR gates, already being used for generating D’•C’. Segments b, c and e have the simplest expressions and are thus possible candidates for this option. Find out which of these three would be the best choice for realisation using 2-input NOR gates.
  We will thus be using three dual 4-input multiplexers (74LS153), and one quad 2-input NOR gate (74LS02).

		<h2>Digital Logic Design</h2><br/>
		This experiment is designed to simulate any digital logical circuit.Following are the instruction for building the circuit.The whole Applet consist of mainly four pannels i.e Left Pannel , Mid Pannel , Right Pannel and Top Pannel.
		<ol>
		<li>
		<b>Left Pannel</b> 

		</li>
		<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Gate Combobox: </b> So this combox box is used to select basic gates like and,or,exor,not,nor,nand ,exnor and connector .Once Gate is selected then corresponding number of inputs can be selected from the combo box adjacent to it.After clicking this you just have to click on mid pannel drawing area, and gate will be placed at that particular location.
		</li>
	<li>
	<b>Probe:</b>Generaly terminal output is shown by default, if you want explicitly Input and output of various node , then you have to probe it.
</li>
<li>
	<b>None:</b>It is used to get default cursor option back, so that you can do basic operation like drag and drop .
</li>

<li><b>Delete Element:</b> This is used for explicitly deleting certain element. You just have to click on those element.
</li>
<li><b>Connect/Disconnect:</b>This used for establishing and removing connection between various element. Connection can be established only from output to input.You have to first click to the output node then to the input node(consist of red square box) . For disconnection , also same procedure but this time you can start by clicking either of  input or output node.</li>
<li><b>Naming:</b>This is used for giving name to either input or output node. Just click on the node, then one input box will pop out in which you can give the name.
</li>
<li><b>Output:</b>Generally this is used for explicitly defining yhe output node. Its purpose will be more clear in explanation of import button.</li>
<li><b>Time Pulse</b>You have to enter time pulse in definate pattern i.e <timepulse_name>:<uptime>,<downtime>,<uptime>,<downtime> and so on.For ex: 0,10,10,10,10 . After that press enter or click on the new timepulse. Then, it will be created and available as input in list box.</li>
<li><b>Binary One And Zero</b>These are used to give value to terminal input and output</b></li>
</ol>
<li><b>Top Pannel</b></li>
<ol>
<li><b>Clear:</b>It is used to clear every element on the circuit</li>
<li><b>Save:</b>It is used for saving the circuit as file which can be loaded and imported.</li>
<li><b>Load:</b>It load the save circuit as it is without any change. It would be fresh circuit with no previous value stored.</li>
<li><b>Import:</b>Now it is a very important feature. It is simmilar to load , but circuit will appear as black box with terminal input ,terminal output and those output which are set by the output button on left pannel. So, in this recursively you can make many circuit.The input and output nodes will come in order of top to bottom on the basis of there vertical position while saving.It is imported as geeneric element whose name is derived from saved file's name.</li>
<li><b>Simulate:</b>This is used to compute the whole circuit , if all the terminal inputs are present . It also compute the gate delays , which can be known by hovering the mouse over the gates. By default gate delay is kept to be -1. Simulation can fail or give ambiguous result if circuit do not stablizes with time. This generally happens in the case of improper construction of feedbacks. For ex : If You use direct feedback in flip flop it will give You wrong or no result , i.e why use master slave architecture to build flip flop. </li>
</ol>

<li><b>Mid Pannel:</b>It is the just drawing area used for building various circuits.You can move various element in mid pannel by simple drag and drop.</li>


<li><b>Right Pannel:</b>It is used for showing time varying terminal inputs ,outputs and also probed input and output.It will have element name and input or output index associated with it. Indexes are given top to bottom.</li>

</ol>
<li><b>Note:</b>There is sample circuit for each experiment is given at the home page. You can try them with the help of save or import button.</li>

		1) Design the BCD to seven segment display decoder as given in the theory section. Save this circuit which takes four inputs D,C,B, A and produces 7 outputs a,b,c,d,e,f,g.
		<br/><br/>
		2) The Seven segment display designed above can display digits from 0 to 9. Now design a circuit which can display hexadecimal numbers 0-9 and A-F. Start by making K-maps for a,b,c,d,e,f,g and use seven 4:1 / 8:1 multiplexers, each generating one output.
		<br/>
		Save this circuit with appropriate name.
		<br/><br/>
		3) A 4-bit ripple adder has been made in Experiment 1. It takes two 4-bit numbers A3A2A1A0 and B3B2B1B0 as inputs and generates their sum S3S2S1S0 and final carry C-out.
		<br/>		
		Save the 4-bit ripple adder by marking appropriate inputs and outputs.
		<br/>		
		Import the seven segment hexadecimal display designed in question 2. 
		<br/>
		Import the 4 bit ripple adder.
		<br/>		
		Connect the outputs S3S2S1S0 of ripple adder to the inputs DCBA of 7 segment hexadecimal display.  Give two 4-bit binary numbers as inputs to ripple adder and see if their sum is being displayed by the seven segment hexadecimal display.
